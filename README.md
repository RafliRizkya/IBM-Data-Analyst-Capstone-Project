# IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project
This repository contains my capstone project from the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate, where I applied various data analysis techniques and tools to gain insights from technology-related data.

ðŸ›  Project Overview
In this project, I:

âœ… Used Jupyter Notebook to:
- Define and implement functions for data processing.
- Perform data cleaning and transformation to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.
- Visualize key metrics to support data-driven decision-making.
  
âœ… Analyzed the most commonly used technologies, including:
- Programming languages
- Databases
- latforms
- Web frameworks
  
âœ… Created an interactive dashboard to visualize key findings and trends.
